去掉逗号之后，地名和时间nlp的判断会有差别。 比如在有逗号情况下  Indian Institute of Science, Bengalaru, India, January 4, 2019
 第一个识别为People,第二个为country，时间会多出一个逗号.  但去掉逗号后，会识别为一长串 organization.

为了便捷(去掉逗号后，起码用RE匹配时间会方便点) 我们去掉comma.
因此，在Location recognization 过程中， 我们需要观察生成的输出，把一些无法识别的字符串，要提前将nerTag改为对应值。
比如, Bengalaru 标签应该为 CITY.
